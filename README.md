## More about Corner Popup

What is Corner Popup? It's a simple pop-up component that can be used on almost all modern websites. It simply displays small pop-up box in corner of the browser. Corner Popup is fully configurable and you can change many parameters - position, window color, content inside etc. Corner Popup is easy to use and you don't need programming skills. As a component Corner Popup needs only jquery to work. It is fully responsive without using any framework.

## How to use

Using Corner Popup is very simple. As the first step, add jquery and Corner Popup files for the project (remember to add appropriate files to folders):

```
<link rel="stylesheet" href="css/corner-popup.min.css">
<script src="https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.3.1.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/corner-popup.min.js"></script>
```

As step 2 call script from your website code:

```
<script>
$('body').cornerpopup({
});
</script>
```

In step 3 you can (but it's not necessary) set some options in previously added code:
```
<script>
$('body').cornerpopup({
'variant': 1,
'slide': 1
});
</script>
```
